# LogiQ

A simple function to OpenWebUI, it uses the llm to convert the problem into python code where it would print the solution using human language, the code is then executed (limited by safe functions) and the output is then printed as answer.


Insert the prefix /logiq when you want to enable it for current message  

# Example:  
/logiq How many r's are in the word stratosphere?  

# Requires:  
Open WebUI 0.3.31 or above as it requires "Expandable Content Markdown Support"  
Only compatible with ollama at moment!
